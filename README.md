- **Tkinter** (for GUI interface)
- **scikit-learn** (for NLP model training)

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** based chatbot capable of answering various queries.
- **Deep learning model** trained on [dataset name].
- Simple **GUI** built with Tkinter for easy interaction.
- Web-based deployment option (Flask app) for online access.
- User conversation history is stored for analytics (optional).
